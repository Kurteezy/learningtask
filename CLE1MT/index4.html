<p style="font-size:20px">Overpopulation occurs when the human population grows to a level that exceeds the natural setting's carrying capacity. People may outnumber available vital supplies for survival in an overcrowded environment, such as transportation, water, housing, food, or social facilities.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px">Annually, an estimated 81 million individuals are added to the world's population. Overpopulation has its worst consequences and issues in areas with the highest population density (the number of people living in a given area). Populations will constantly grow due to immigration, lower death rates, medical discoveries, and higher birth rates, eventually leading to overpopulation. When we say "overpopulation," we're referring to a situation in which the Earth's resources cannot be replenished each year to meet the demands of the world's population. According to experts, this has been the case every year since 1970, with each year getting increasingly destructive. We need to understand what's causing overpopulation and overconsumption, as well as how these trends are influencing everything from climate change to sociopolitical turmoil, in order to help moderate this dangerously unsustainable scenario.</p>
