    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <td>Dried Pasta... any work well</td>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <td>1)Boil your pasta adding salt to the water for later on.</td>
    <br><br>
    <td>2)While pasta is cooking grate your cheese/drain your tuna.</td>
    <br><br>
    <td>3.)When the pasta is cooked add about half a tube of tomato puree, stirring well, to give you a passata consistency. Of course you can just use passata if you want, and drain the pasta instead.</td>
