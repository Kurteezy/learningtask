    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <td>Rice (as much as you fancy really!)</td>
    <br>
  <td>Half an onion (Or more, again if you fancy it)</td>
    <br>
  <td>A tin of sweetcorn </td>
    <br>
<td>A few mushrooms </td>
    <br>
    <td>1-to‐2 eggs</td>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <td>1)Start cooking the rice however you do, and put some oil in a frying pan.</td>
    <br><br>
    <td>2)Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesnt matter particularly and throw into the frying pan.</td>
    <br><br>
    <td>3.)Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions.</td>
    <br><br>
    <td>4.)Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan.</td>
    <br><br>
    <td>5.)Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up.</td>
    <br><br>
    <td>6)Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up.</td>
    <br><br>
    <p>At this point, you need to keep stirring the mixture, keeping the eggs moving. Keep going until the eggs have cooked, should take about 5-to‐8 minutes maybe?</p>
